    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe will result in juicy, flavorful chuck roast tacos feeding 6+ people per serving. This is one of my 
        go-to, easy to make weekly recipes. Authentic? I don't know, but I do know it yields a large amount of food for small amount of effort.
        This isn't some copy and paste recipe for the sake of The Odin Project, but a recipe created over time from trial and error. I loved cooking far before
        I found a love for learning programming. Enjoy! Feedback will always be welcome!

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Cooking the chuck roast</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Half moon all of the onions</li>
        <li>Heat a meadium to large pan over medium-high heat</li>
        <li>Put half of the onions and all of the beef stock in a large crock pot and place on low heat</li>
        <li>Combine in a small dish chili powder, garlic powder, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper generously. This will be used to 
            coat the chuck roast before searing</li>
        <li>After seasoning is blended together, cover the chuck roast generously in all crevices, sides, and edges</li>
        <li>Put oil in pan and sear the chuck roast about 3-4 minutes per side and each edge for about 45 seconds to 1 minute</li>
        <li>Place the chuck roast in the crock pot and put the other half of the onions over the top. Note: I love the onions that come out of this recipe, so feel free to add or take away based on personal preferance or crock pot size. 
            For my crock pot, I have to use tongs to adjust the onions of the course of the cook.</li>
        <li>Add thyme and about 2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>Turn the crock pot to low for about 6-7 hours until the chuck roast is tender and falls apart</li>
        <li>Optional: Chop the cilantro</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Making the tacos</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a small pan on medium heat</li>
        <li>To cook the corn tortillas: heat one side, flip, rub with a stick of butter and flip again. Add cheese</li>
        <li>Once cheese melts fully, or even slightly, remove from heat</li>
        <li>Repeat until desired number of tortillas are created</li>
        <li>Shred the chuck roast and add small amount to tacos</li>
        <li>Top with cilantro and salsa</li>
        <li>Note: you can make rice to add into tacos or on the side. I will typically use minute rice jasmine rice cups, and sometimes even crisp up some hashbrowns.</li>
        <li>Bonus note: the broth from the chuck roast and onions makes for some great ramen!</li>
    </ol>
