Odin Project Recipe Website 

This is project will provide a starting point for solidifying HTML concepts up to this point while later approaches will integrate CSS and JS concepts.
Up to this point, I have developed a foundation in understanding basic HTML concepts alongside using the Linus  Bash CLI, and understanding directory relationships, navigating those, and using Git commands for commits to GitHub. Thus far, the Odin Project has been a smooth learning experience, and I have enjoyed every bit of the learning process. I have not found a single piece of this project to be overly burdensome or difficult, as long as careful reading and comprehension practices are in place. This project will highlight not only what I have learned so far, but allow me some creative space to explore HTML, CSS, and JS concepts outside of the basics The Odin Project Provides.
